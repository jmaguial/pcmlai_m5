# Findings
## Scope
Completed analysis for the BAR coupon.

## Considerations
* Age is a key parameter on understanding acceptance ratio. Understood to be driven by legal requirement (US law forbids drinking under age of 21). It has been determined that for age >25 the acceptance rate increases
* Frequency of visiting bars does not seem to be very determining factor as, as long as the driver goes to a bar more than once a month, the acceptance ratio is more or less stable
* Driving partner is a determining factor when it is kids, dropping the acceptance rate to around 50% in such case
* For the most part, occupation does not seem to be a determining factor. With few exceptions, acceptance ratio is >1
